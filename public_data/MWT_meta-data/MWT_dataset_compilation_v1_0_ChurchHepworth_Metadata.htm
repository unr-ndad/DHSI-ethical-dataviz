<dd>

This document serves as the metadata for the table MWT_dataset_compilation_v1_0_ChurchHepworth.csv, which is itself a derivation of the MonroeWorkToday Dataset Compilation (version 1.0) that resides at the Tuskegee University Archives, dated 23 Oct 2017. This table contains one observation for each victim of a lynching in the United States from 1803-2011 in which a person (of any race) was murdered by mob action in the name of some transgression (real or imagined) against white supremacy. Some observations are included which were not interpreted by auut studio to be motivated by white supremacy, and are marked as such. For the subset contained here, all observations of victims who were known to be white, whose murders did not seem to indicate a motivation by white supremacy, have been removed from the original compilation. 
<br/>
<br/>
The data for the MonroeWorkToday Dataset Compilation originated with the historic record-keeping of Tuskegee Institute, conducted in the early 1900s by its Director of Records and Research, Mr. Monroe Nathan Work. These lynching records are currently stored in Box 132 at the Tuskegee University Archives. These records were merged by auut studio with the Tolnay &amp; Beck inventory of lynchings [1995 database] in a manual process to integrate all its additions and corrected information for the ten Southern States. The data assembly was then repeated for 62 more scholarly sources in order to include research published 1995 to 2015, including: lynching studies of other US states, narrative accounts mentioned in books, as well as academic journal articles that consider Sicilian-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and others. Each new source was integrated by hand to prevent the duplication of records.
<br/>
<br/>
Extreme effort was taken by auut studio to stitch together these sources carefully under the following guiding principle: more recent, geographically-specific, or updated studies are allowed to correct the details given in a source that is older, more general, or was less confident of its own assessment.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition, auut studio labeled each observation with a code to represent the historical county in which the source author identified for the event. The codes for these historical counties, some of which are now extinct, follows the schema of the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries <a href="http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/">&lt;http://publications.newberry.org/ahcbp/&gt;</a>.

<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

This file provides an unfiltered table of potential victims of lynchings in the United States that were perpetrated by a mob of people who appear to have been enforcing the social order of white supremacy. The word &quot;potential&quot; refers to the fact that further interpretation is needed by any researcher engaged with this data, as to whether some observations fit the researcher's own definition of lynching, and/or were indeed motivated by white supremacy.

<h3>For years prior to 1882, this compilation is known to be missing most or all lynching events for some states during those years. This compilation is not suitable for comparative analysis of regions prior to 1882.</h3>

<h3>This dataset consciously includes some observations which are ambiguous, and is not a &quot;neat&quot; or clear-cut list of victims. Any researcher who engages with this compilation must filter the list, and in so doing make some of their own decisions about which observations they intend to include.</h3>

<dd>
This dataset compiles the prior research of dozens of academic scholars and authors. It inherits any inaccuracy or omission contained in each of these sources, unless later authors corrected the data in that earlier source. The geographic coverage and temporal coverage of events is a patchwork and not at all comprehensive.
<br><br>
For some cases, the table indicates an observation being &quot;Uncertain&quot; or &quot;Unconfirmed&quot; as to fitting the definition of a lynching. Unless otherwise indicated, this uncertainty is the interpretation from the source author(s).
<br><br>
The compilation does not contain every lynching there ever was in the US. There will never be such a &quot;perfect&quot; list, because they were not always reported in a newspaper, or occurred in towns too small to have a newspaper. Some murders may have a faint record in historical sources, or none at all.
<br><br>
For years prior to 1882, this compilation is known to be missing most or all cases of lynching in certain states. This gap is especially true for these states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia. This represents a major omission, and is due to the temporal coverage of the sources that were publicly available at the time this compilation was completed (in early 2016). As one measure of scale for data known to be missing: a separate, private inventory of lynchings updated by Dr. E.M. Beck (as of November 2016) contains 753 lynchings of Black or Native American victims in the Southern states occuring between 1865-1881. These are not contained in this MonroeWorkToday Dataset Compilation.
